I also have experience using Node.js, Express and PostgreSQL to handle with data management. I started my developer journey learning on free resources like freeCodeCamp and CodeAcademy. I then wanted further guidance and a more set curriculum which came in the form of LearningFuze, a full-immersion web-development bootcamp. Not only did I learn full-stack web-development but also how to become a better learner.\n\n\n I am dependable, driven and committed to learning as much as possible. I am hard-working and willing to put in the time and effort to achieve my goals.\n\n\n Thank you for your time and please contact me with any further questions. ",
